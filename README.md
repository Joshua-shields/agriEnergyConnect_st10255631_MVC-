## User Roles and Credentials

The system supports two distinct user roles. Sample user accounts should have been created by the database setup script.

*   **Farmer:**
    *   Can add products to their profile.
    *   Can view their own product listings.
  
*   **Employee:**
    *   Can add new farmer profiles to the system.
